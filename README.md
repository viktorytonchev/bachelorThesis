# bachelorThesis
The code used for my Bachelor Thesis for the Technical Computer Science course at University of Twente

This repository contains 4 files which were used to build the ML models described in my thesis.
The files cannot be run as they require the pickle files made using data from the experiment, but those cannot be uploaded for privacy reasons.
And so they are only here as a reference for how the models were built. Also included is the paper for the thesis itself with the results of the models.
